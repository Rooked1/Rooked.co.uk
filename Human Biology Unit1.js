    "What are Somatic Cells?":"Somatic cells are diploid cells and contain two sets of homologous  chromosomes.A somatic cell is any cell in the body other than cells involved in  reproduction (gametes).",
     "What are Diploid Cells?":"A Diploid cell contains two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. Most cells in the human body are diploid.",
     "How many chromosomes do Diploid cells have?":"Diploid cells in humans have 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.",
    "What happens to Diploid cells during cell division?":"During cell division the nucleus of a somatic cell divides by mitosis to  maintain the diploid chromosome number.", 
    "How do Somatic cells divide?":"Somatic cells divide by mitosis to form more somatic cells which  differentiate to form different body tissue types",
    "Are Mutations in somantic cells passed to offspring?":"They do not",
    "What are Germline cells?":"Germline cells are gametes (sperm and ova) and the stem cells that divide  to form gametes.", 
    "What 2 ways do the nucleus of Germline cells divide?":"The nucleus of germline cells divide by mitosis to produce more germline  cells (maintaining the chromosome number) or by meiosis to produce  haploid gametes.",
    "Descripe what happens in meiosis of a nucleus of a  Germline cell?":"In meiosis the nucleus of a germline cell undergoes two divisions, firstly  separating homologous chromosomes and secondly separating chromatids. • Haploid gametes contain 23 single chromosomes.",
    "Can mutations in Germline cells be passed on?":"Yes they can",
    "What is cellular differentation?":"Cellular differentiation is the process by which a cell develops more  specialised functions.",
    "How does cellular differentation occur?":"Cellular differentiation occurs by expressing only the genes characteristic of  that type of cell.Once a cell becomes differentiated, it only expresses the genes that  produce the proteins characteristic for that type of cell.",
    "Describe Stem cells?":"Stem cells are relatively unspecialised cells. Stem cells are able to continue to divide to produce more stem cells or cells  which will differentiate into specialised cells of one or more types.",
    "During embryological development what happens to unspecialised cells?":"During embryological development, the unspecialised cells of the early  embryo differentiate into cells with specialised functions. ",
    "Where are Embryonic stem cells found?":"Embryonic stem cells are found in the inner cell mass (epiblast) of the  blastocyst.",
    "What cell types can embryonic stem cells develop into?":"Embryonic stem cells are capable of developing into any of the body's cell  types (pluripotent)",
    "What is the function of adult stem cells?":"Tissue (adult) stem cells replenish differentiated cells that need to be  replaced.",
    "In what numbers are adult stem cells found?":"Tissue (adult) stem cells are found in very small numbers throughout the  body tissues.",
    "What do adult stem cells give rise to?":"Tissue (adult) stem cells give rise to a limited range of cell types typical of  the organ of which they are a part (multipotent). They have a limited  differentiation potential.or example, blood stem cells located in bone marrow can give rise to red  blood cells, platelets, phagocytes and lymphocytes.",
     "Give an example of stem cells giving roise to a limited range of cells?":"For example, blood stem cells located in bone marrow can give rise to red blood cells, platelets, phagocytes and lymphocytes.",
    "Why are stem cells useful for research?":"Stem cells are useful for research because they are capable of giving rise to a range of cell types and can be cultured indefinitely in the laboratory.",
    "What cell  processes have stem cell research contributed to?":"Stem cell research has contributed to our understanding of cell processes such as growth, differentiation and gene regulation.",
    "Stem cells cultured from patients with particular diseases can be used for what?":"Stem cells cultured from patients suffering from particular conditions can be used to produce very specific cultures for use in testing a wide range of drugs, e.g. Alzheimer's disease.",
     "Why do stem cells have theraputic use?":"Stem cells have therapeutic uses because they are pluripotent and can be stimulated in culture to form a wide variety of tissues.",
    "What can stem cells be used for?":"Stem cells can be used in the repair of damaged or diseased organs and  tissues.",
    "In corneal repair what does the use of stem cells do?":"In corneal repair, the use of corneal stem cells from the patient's own tissue speeds up the process, creates new healthy tissue, and reduces the chance of rejection.",
    "How do stem cells assist in cell grafting?":"In skin grafting, the use of epidermal stem cells allows the much more rapid production of a temporary graft, which reduces the risk of dehydration or infection.",
    "What are the principal ethical concerns abput stem cells?":"The principal ethical issues associated with stem cell use in research apply to embryonic stem cell use.The ethical objections to the use of embryonic stem cells are principally that an embryo is destroyed in the process.",
    "Why do cancer cells divide excessively and what does this cause?":"Cancer cells divide excessively because they do not respond to regulatory signals.This results in a mass of abnormal cells called a tumour.",
    "Why do tumours spread throughout the body?":"Cells within the tumour may fail to attach to each other, spreading through the body where they may form secondary tumours.",
    "What is a benign tumour?":"A benign tumour is one which does not invade neighbouring tissues or spread throughout the body.",
    "What is a malignant tumour?":"A malignant tumour is one in which the cells lose the molecules on their surface that normally hold them in place; they can therefore become detached from their neighbours and spread through the body in the blood or lymphatic circulation.",
    "What is the original tumour and the detached cells called?":"The original tumour is called the primary tumour and those forming from the detached cells are called secondary tumours.",
